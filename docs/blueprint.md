# **App Name**: HealthTestAI

## Core Features:

- Requirement Parsing: Parse requirements from various document formats (PDF, Word, XML, Markup) using Gemini's natural language processing to understand healthcare-specific terminology and regulations.
- Test Case Generation: Generate comprehensive test cases covering functional, non-functional, and edge cases based on parsed requirements. Utilizes Vertex AI for advanced ML model deployment to ensure thorough test coverage and tool use where appropriate.
- Compliance Mapping: Automatically map each generated test case to relevant regulatory standards (FDA, IEC 62304, ISO 9001, ISO 13485, ISO 27001, GDPR) to ensure compliance.
- Traceability Matrix: Maintain bidirectional links between requirements and generated test cases, providing full traceability throughout the software development lifecycle.
- ALM Export: Export generated test cases in formats compatible with Jira, Polarion, and Azure DevOps, ensuring seamless integration with existing enterprise toolchains.
- Data Anonymization: Anonymize any included sensitive health data and display a GDPR compliance report summary using BigQuery analysis. This will also suggest any missing information in the compliance flow.
- Test Case Visualization: Visualize the generated test cases, compliance mappings, and traceability matrices in an interactive dashboard for easy navigation and analysis.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#2E9AFE), representing trust and clarity, crucial in healthcare applications.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#EBF5FB) to provide a calm, clean interface.
- Accent color: A soft green (#A9DFBF) to highlight important elements and actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, objective look. It is suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, intuitive icons to represent test case status, compliance levels, and integration points.
- Design a clean, well-organized layout with clear visual hierarchy to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of complex data.
- Incorporate subtle animations for user feedback, such as loading indicators and successful test case generation notifications.
